# Additional Reading

## Hapi Edge 

These guys wrote the book (literally).  Some of my colleagues from Walmart show how to set up [controllers](https://github.com/hapijs-edge/hapi-plugins.com/tree/master/lib/controllers) and [models](https://github.com/hapijs-edge/hapi-plugins.com/tree/master/lib/models) in order to be more organized. Because organized code is hapi code. 


## Resources

Speaking of that book, there are links on the [resources](http://hapijs.com/resources) page of Hapijs.com that include working [boilerplates](http://hapijs.com/resources#Boilerplates) and [tutorials](http://hapijs.com/resources#Tutorials) to help you get started quickly!
